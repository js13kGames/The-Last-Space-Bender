## What is JS13KGames

[JS13kGames.com](https://js13kgames) is a JavaScript coding competition for HTML5 Game Developers. The fun part of the compo is the file size limit set to 13 kilobytes


This is my first time joining JS13KGames, and yeah this year theme is **Space**, which means anything about `space` if about Space ðŸš€, a keyboard space, or even a physical space.

## About my game

I really love playing Dragon Nest Sea and recently I played as `Force User` which is really awesome, she play forces, explosions and even `space` (I don't know maybe I'm just the only one who's assuming that she uses space). So I'm thinking of making a hero having power which is `Negative Space`, which allow the hero to shot a projectile to enemies and pulling other enemies nearby.

I'm using [kontraJS](https://straker.github.io/kontra) created by `Sir Steven Lambert`, which is a lightweight JavaScript gaming micro-library.
